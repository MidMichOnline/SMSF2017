The Festival is held the last full week of April each year. During Syrup Festival week there are numerous garage & yard sales. Thursday night is our annual Carnival "Buddy Nite". We start the Carnival with buy one ride band and get a second ride band for half price. The Carnival rides open at 5:00 p.m.
We look forward to celebrating the our 58th Annual Maple Syrup Festival with you!
